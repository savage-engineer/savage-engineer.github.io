            <h1>Fraser Savage</h1>

<h3 class="subheader">Who am I?</h3>

<p>
I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at University College London.
</p>

<h3 class="subheader">What I've been up to:</h3>

<h4 class="subheader">Volunteering in Tech</h4>

<p class="brace-effect">
In March 2016 I organised and ran an introductory workshop on object oriented programming with Java. The workshop was targeted to UK sixth-form & college students interested in Computing and was part of<a href="http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/schools-engagement/news/hackstart-coding-workshops-by-techsoc/">HackStart</a>:
</p>

<p class="block-quote">
Hackstart aims to inspire 14-17 year olds to take a deeper interest in Computer Science through workshops, demos and tech talks. Organised by UCL Computer Science students, for school pupils â€“ we hope to pass on our passion for technology to the next generation!
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Open Source</h4>

<p class="brace-effect">
During the first year of my degree we were given a couple of open-ended projects, some of them working in groups. One such project developed into<a href="https://ucl-coffeeschool.github.io/coffeeschool/">Coffee School</a>, an interactive set of lessons teaching introductory JavaScript. These run in-browser and culminate in the student creating a flappy-bird style game prototype.
</p>

<p class="brace-effect"> 
The code for the lessons and the platform they run on is up on<a href="https://github.com/ucl-coffeeschool/coffeeschool/">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Hackathons!</h4>

<p class="brace-effect">
Over the past year I've been to a fair few hackathons, from BrumHack and BathHack to hackCambridge and HackLondon. Not all of these events yielded a completed "thing". From trying out new technologies to building something cool, just because, I've found that I learned a lot during the past year.
</p>

<p class="brace-effect">
Things made range from<a href="https://github.com/savage-engineer/Brumhack3.0">Stockstroids</a>, an asteroids prototype where the game logic is determined by data from Bloomberg's API, to weird hacks involving an Intel Edison, VB, Windows 95/98 and translation into morsecode (all at once!).
